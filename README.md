Publish your liked songs from Spotify to GitHub as JSON

### Background

Someone asked me what I listen to, and it turns out Spotify doesn't allow sharing your full list of liked songs. So I made this thing. It utilizes the OAuth flows of GitHub and Spotify to publish a `playlist.json` file in the root of a default branch of a chosen GitHub repo.

### Requirements

- python3
- A [GitHub app](https://github.com/settings/apps) with a classic personal access token, permission to read and write a repo's contents, and a callback URL of `http://localhost:9000/github-callback.html`
- A [Spotify app](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) with a redirect URI of `http://localhost:9000/spotify-callback.html`

### Execution

`$ GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=whatever python3 -m http.server --cgi 9000`

Then visit [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/)

### Example

[https://github.com/danrashid/playlist/blob/master/playlist.json](https://github.com/danrashid/playlist/blob/master/playlist.json) is generated by this application. [https://www.danrashid.com/playlist/](https://www.danrashid.com/playlist/) renders it.
